	<p>
		Cary Grant is a typical 1950's man.<br>
		All he really knows how to do is put on his suit and fedora in the morning, drink coffee<br>
		and alcohol, smoke cigarettes, seduce women, and speak with a Trans-Atlantic accent.<br>
		<br>
		You are entrusted with keeping him happy! Make sure he doesn't go hungry,<br>
		get too bored, or get too tired, otherwise he will die, which can't happen<br>
		because then the plot wouldn't work.<br>
		Have fun!
